# EchoShade

Short description
EchoShade is a production-ready application providing a scalable, secure, and observable foundation for building real-time services and APIs. This README covers installation, development workflow, deployment and contribution guidelines.

Key features

- Minimal, well-documented codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Config-driven: 12-factor friendly, environment-first configuration
- Containerized for consistent deployment (Docker)
- Built-in health checks, logging and metrics hooks
- Comprehensive test and CI strategy

Tech stack (example)

- Language: Node.js (TypeScript) or Python (optionally)
- Frameworks: Express / Fastify or FastAPI
- Container: Docker
- CI: GitHub Actions
- Observability: Structured logs (JSON), metrics (Prometheus), tracing (optional)

Quick start (Docker)

1. Build and run:

```
docker build -t echoshade:latest .
docker run -e NODE_ENV=production -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env echoshade:latest
```

2. Health check:

```
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health
```

Local development

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repo-url> && cd echoshade
```

2. Install dependencies (example Node):

```
npm install
```

3. Copy environment file and configure:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

5. Run tests and lint:

```
npm test
npm run lint
```

Configuration

- Use environment variables for all configuration (port, DB connection, external API keys).
- Provide a .env.example with required keys and safe defaults.
- Prefer typed/config-validated loading (e.g., zod, joi, pydantic).

Project layout (recommended)

- /src — application source
- /src/api — HTTP routes and controllers
- /src/services — business logic
- /src/lib — utilities, logging, metrics
- /tests — unit and integration tests
- /deploy — Dockerfile, k8s manifests, helm charts

Observability & reliability

- Log structured JSON to stdout; include correlation IDs
- Expose /health and /metrics endpoints
- Capture errors and attach contextual metadata before reporting
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

Security

- Validate and sanitize all external inputs
- Avoid secrets in source; use vaults or secret managers in production
- Keep dependencies up to date and enable automated security scanning in CI

CI / CD

- Build, lint, and test on every PR
- Run integration tests in a reproducible environment (Docker Compose)
- Publish artifacts and promote immutable images through environments (staging → production)

Testing strategy

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API contracts and persistence
- End-to-end smoke tests for critical flows
- Use test fixtures and isolated test databases

Contribution

- Follow conventional commits and semantic versioning
- Open PRs against main; include tests for new behavior
- Document public APIs and breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md

License & contact

- Add a LICENSE file (MIT/Apache2 recommended for permissive usage)
- For questions or support, open an issue or contact the maintainers via the project repo

Maintainer checklist (before releasing)

- Update CHANGELOG with notable changes
- Bump version and tag release
- Verify migration scripts and backward compatibility
- Ensure monitoring and alert rules are in place

This README is intended as a production-grade template — adapt sections to reflect the actual stack, conventions, and operational practices used by the EchoShade project.
